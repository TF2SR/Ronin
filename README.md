#### Transitioning from SRMM?

SRMM and Ronin aren't fundamentally incompatible, but they might end up clashing in weird ways. So to uninstall SRMM, download the [Uninstall-SRMM-Carepackage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-qbEkztYeT4r4YmUWHthvpY8Wsm3gx8x/view?usp=sharing) and follow the instructions written in the `README.txt`

## Installation

Simply drag & drop all the files from the `Ronin.release.vX.X.X.zip` into your main Titanfall2 directory

You can add the Launcher to your Steam library by clicking the `[+] Add a Game` -> `Add a Non-Steam Game` and then add the executable. You can also give it extra launch options through Steam that way

## Development

Ronin's development is split into 2 repositories:

1. [RoninSDK](https://github.com/TF2SR/RoninSDK) (Code for the C++ hook DLL)
1. [RoninScripts](https://github.com/TF2SR/RoninScripts) (Code for the squirrel scripts that add menus & other features)
